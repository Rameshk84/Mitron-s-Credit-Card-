**At-a-Glance ðŸ‘€**
I worked on the Mitron Bank customer transactional data to identify key clients, preferences, and other insights as part of Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 8. Completing the detailed Power BI report in about 20 days, meeting the 30-day deadline. The report includes key insights, KPIs, and easy-to-understand visuals for informed decision-making on the new credit line. Additionally, I provided recommendations based on recent market trends and insights to align the credit line with emerging trends and key-client preferences.

**Problem**
Mitron Bank wantâ€™s to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

ðŸ‘‰However, Mitron Bank needs to know their key-clients and their preferences to launch a new credit line.
**Solution**
Iâ€™ve analyzed the pilot data of 4000 customers demographic and spending patterns to find their key-clients, their top preferred categories, and when they spend the most. Which helps Mitron Bankâ€™s strategy team in developing targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

ðŸš€These findings and insights where provided with a user-friendly Power BI report.

**Process**
After studying the provided dataset and other insights, I conducted background research on recent credit trends. This helped in forming accurate recommendations. I began by crafting necessary queries to identify essential KPIs, prioritize insights, and develop a user-friendly visualization report.

**Dashboard Design and Visualization**
The dashboard design starts with choosing visuals for each metric, followed by selecting the color palette and layout style. Then, I arrange visuals and adjust page navigation across all report pages. In this simple version, you can see how the I approach solves the user needs.

**Recommendations**
Key clients fall within the age range of 25-45.

Key client locations: Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru.
Delhi is a significant market; focus on increasing the client base in this region.
